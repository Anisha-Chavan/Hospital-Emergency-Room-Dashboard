# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard project provides key insights into various metrics related to the hospital emergency room operations. The dashboard allows hospital management to track and analyze data on patient waiting times, resource utilization, and overall emergency room performance. The project follows these steps:

Requirement Gathering: Understanding stakeholder needs to identify critical metrics such as patient wait times, staff allocation, and treatment times.
Data Collection: Aggregating data from hospital systems such as Electronic Health Records (EHR), admission systems, and operational databases.
Transformation and Modeling: Cleaning and transforming the raw data into a structured format to support effective analysis and visualization.
Dashboard Layout and Design: Creating an intuitive, user-friendly design to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) like patient flow, emergency cases handled, and staffing levels.
Interactivity and Navigation: Adding interactive features such as slicers, filters, and drill-through capabilities for dynamic exploration of the data.
Testing: Ensuring data accuracy, verifying calculations, and testing dashboard performance to provide reliable insights.
The project provides valuable insights to hospital administrators and emergency room staff for monitoring performance, identifying bottlenecks, and making data-driven decisions to enhance operational efficiency and patient care.
